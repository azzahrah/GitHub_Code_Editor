## GitHub Code Editor

You can use this online tool to log in your Github account, select repositorie, list code files, and edit any file in browser.

The entire program is done with codeless programming. The GitHub login function uses a cloud service module - [GitHubSimpleAPI](https://github.com/linb/CrossUI_Assets/tree/master/assets/modules/Services/xui_module_tpl_GitHubAPISimple), which works out of the box, enable your users log in to GitHub and operate their repositories directly. In [CrossUI Builder](https://crossui.com/RADGithub), you can add it to your own project from CrossUI templates library.
